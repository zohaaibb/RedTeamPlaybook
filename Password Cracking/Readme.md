# üîê Password Cracking

This repository provides an overview of password cracking methodologies, covering both **offline** and **online** techniques, associated challenges, and tools used in ethical hacking and penetration testing.

## üß≠ Topics Covered

### ‚úÖ Offline vs Online Password Cracking

#### üîπ Offline Cracking
- Involves obtaining password **hashes** (e.g., from `/etc/shadow` or Windows `SAM` file) and cracking them locally.
- Offers unlimited attempts without alerting the target system.
- Faster when using powerful hardware or GPU acceleration.
- Often uses **dictionary attacks**, **rule-based attacks**, or **brute force** on the hashes.

#### üîπ Online Cracking
- Involves attempting to log in directly to a live system using guessed passwords.
- Limited by lockout policies, rate limits, and detection.
- Riskier and slower, but still viable in specific attack scenarios.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues in Password Cracking

- **Password complexity**: Length, character diversity, and randomness increase difficulty.
- **Hashing algorithms**: Slow algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) make brute force infeasible without powerful resources.
- **Account lockouts**: In online cracking, repeated attempts may lead to account lockout or IP bans.
- **Detection**: Online cracking attempts may be logged or flagged by security systems.
- **Ethical boundaries**: Cracking should always be done with permission in legal, controlled environments.
