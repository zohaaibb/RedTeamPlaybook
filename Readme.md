# Red Teaming – Offensive Hacking Process Repository

Welcome to the **Red Teaming Repository**, where we dive deep into the offensive side of cybersecurity. This project is dedicated to walking through the **entire hacking process**, step-by-step, using real-world tools, techniques, and hands-on practices.

Whether you're an aspiring Red Teamer, ethical hacker, or penetration tester, this repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and simulating adversarial behavior in a controlled and educational environment.

## 📌 Topics We Cover

### 🔹 1. Passive and Active Reconnaissance
- Understand the target without direct interaction (passive).
- Engage in controlled probing of systems to gather more data (active).
- Tools: `theHarvester`, `Shodan`, `Nmap`, `Recon-ng`, `Amass`

### 🔹 2. Finding Vulnerabilities
- Analyze gathered information to identify potential weaknesses.
- Use scanners and manual techniques.
- Tools: `Nessus`, `Nikto`, `OpenVAS`, `Nmap`, `WhatWeb`

### 🔹 3. Exploitation (Manual & Metasploit)
- Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.
- Use both manual exploits and automated tools like Metasploit.
- Tools: `Metasploit Framework`, `Searchsploit`, `msfvenom`, `Exploit-DB`

### 🔹 4. Network & Protocol Analysis
- Sniff and analyze network traffic to uncover sensitive information.
- Understand protocols and detect misconfigurations.
- Tools: `Wireshark`, `tcpdump`, `Ettercap`, `MITMf`

### 🔹 5. Post-Exploitation
- Perform actions after gaining access: privilege escalation, data exfiltration, maintaining access, etc.
- Tools: `Mimikatz`, `Empire`, `Meterpreter`, `BloodHound`

### 🔹 6. Web Application Hacking
- Explore vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Learn about common flaws like SQLi, XSS, CSRF, LFI/RFI.
- Tools: `Burp Suite`, `OWASP ZAP`, `sqlmap`, `XSStrike`, `wfuzz`

### 🔹 7. Antivirus Evasion & Shellcode
- Create and modify payloads to evade detection.
- Understand how AV engines work and how to bypass them.
- Tools: `msfvenom`, `Veil`, `Shellter`, `Obfuscation scripts`

### 🔹 8. Covering Your Tracks
- Learn how attackers hide evidence and maintain stealth.
- Modify logs, clear traces, and create backdoors.

### 🔹 9. WiFi Hacking
- Cracking WiFi passwords and understanding wireless vulnerabilities.
- Tools: `Aircrack-ng`, `Wifite`, `Reaver`, `hcxdumptool`

### 🔹 10. Malicious Python Scripts
- Write custom Python tools and payloads for offensive use.
- Topics include keyloggers, reverse shells, and automation scripts.

### 🔹 11. Social Engineering
- Psychological manipulation to trick users into revealing information or performing actions.
- Phishing, impersonation, and baiting techniques included.
