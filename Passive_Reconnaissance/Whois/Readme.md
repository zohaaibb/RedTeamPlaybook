# ðŸ“„ Whois - Domain Registration Information Gathering

## ðŸ“Œ What is Whois?

Whenever a domain is registered, the domain owner must provide key details such as:

- Registrar and Nameservers
- Organization or Contact Name
- Physical Address
- Phone Number
- Email Address

This data is stored in **registrar databases** and made publicly accessible through the **Whois protocol** (typically on **port 43**).

Whois lookups are an essential part of **passive reconnaissance** â€” helping gather initial information about the target without direct interaction.
