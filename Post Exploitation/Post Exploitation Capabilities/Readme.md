# Post-Exploitation Capabilities

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Once we gain access to a target system, our **post-exploitation capabilities** depend on several factors.  
These factors determine the **extent of control** we have and what actions we can perform inside the compromised environment.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Factors Influencing Capabilities
1. **Privilege Level**  
   - Do we have **system administrator** (root) privileges or are we limited to a low-privilege user account?
   
2. **Payload Used**  
   - The type of payload affects what post-exploitation features are available.  
     Example: Meterpreter offers file transfers, process migration, and network pivoting.

3. **Service or Application Exploited**  
   - The exploitation vector determines entry point and access scope.  
     Example: Exploiting SMB service grants access through network-level vulnerabilities.

## ðŸ“‚ Example Scenario
- **Target:** Windows 7 system  
- **Exploitation Method:** SMB service vulnerability  
- **Privilege Level:** System Administrator  
- **Payload:** `windows/meterpreter/reverse_http`  

With this combination, we gain **full administrative control**, allowing us to:
- Enumerate and exfiltrate sensitive data
- Create persistent backdoors
- Move laterally to other systems
- Execute any command with highest privileges

---

## âš  Ethical Use Notice
These capabilities should only be demonstrated or tested **in authorized penetration testing engagements**.  
Any unauthorized access or exploitation is **illegal** and punishable under cybersecurity laws.
