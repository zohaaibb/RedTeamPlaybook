# 🌐 OWASP ZAP - Web Application Vulnerability Scanning

This section documents the use of **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)** to discover and analyze security vulnerabilities in web applications through spidering, passive scanning, and active attacks — all in a safe, ethical testing environment.

## 🔍 What is OWASP ZAP?

**OWASP ZAP**, maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project, is one of the most popular **open-source web application security scanners**. It is designed for:
- Security beginners and experts alike
- Automated and manual testing
- Integration into CI/CD pipelines

ZAP supports both **passive scanning** (non-intrusive) and **active scanning** (simulated attacks).

## 🛡️ OWASP ZAP & OWASP Top 10

ZAP is especially useful for identifying vulnerabilities outlined in the **OWASP Top 10**, a standard awareness document that outlines the most critical web application security risks.

### 📋 Common OWASP Top 10 Risks Detectable by ZAP:

| Risk                          | Detected by ZAP |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| A01: Broken Access Control   | ✅ Partially     |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures  | ⚠️ Limited       |
| A03: Injection               | ✅               |
| A04: Insecure Design         | ⚠️ Manual Help   |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | ✅             |
| A06: Vulnerable Components   | ⚠️ Plugin-based  |
| A07: Identification & Authentication Failures | ✅   |
| A08: Software & Data Integrity Failures | ❌       |
| A09: Security Logging & Monitoring Failures | ❌     |
| A10: SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) | ✅ (limited) |

ZAP excels at finding **injections, misconfigurations, missing headers, and authentication issues** — helping secure web apps early.

## ⚙️ Key Features Used

- **Spidering** to map application structure
- **Active scanning** to test forms, inputs, and parameters
- **Alert management** to view, filter, and analyze findings
- **Add-ons** to extend detection capabilities (e.g., Active Scan Rules, Passive Scan Rules)

---

## 📊 Alerts Observed During Testing

- Missing security headers (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`)
- Cookie flags not set (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`)
- Application Error Disclosure
- Cross-Domain JavaScript File Inclusion
- Web Browser XSS Protection not enabled

Each alert includes:
- Risk level (Informational, Low, Medium, High)
- Vulnerability description
- URL affected
- Suggested fix

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

Using OWASP ZAP provided hands-on experience in:
- Identifying real-world web vulnerabilities
- Understanding web attack surfaces and trust boundaries
- Interpreting security alerts and recommending remediations
- Mapping scan findings to the **OWASP Top 10** categories

This tool reinforces secure coding and testing practices — making it an essential asset in every pentester's toolkit.
