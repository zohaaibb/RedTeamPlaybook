# 🎯 Active Reconnaissance in Cybersecurity

## 📖 What is Active Reconnaissance?

**Active reconnaissance** is a technique used by ethical hackers, penetration testers, and adversaries to directly interact with target systems in order to gather critical information. This phase involves sending packets, requests, or queries to a target and analyzing the responses to discover potential vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 Why Is It Important?

Active reconnaissance plays a vital role in cybersecurity assessments. It allows security professionals to:

- Identify **open ports**, **running services**, and **operating systems**
- Discover **technologies** and **frameworks** used in web applications
- Evaluate **attack surfaces** with precision
- Plan targeted attacks based on factual data

Active reconnaissance often makes up **90% of the preparation phase** for real-world attacks — which is why it's also a crucial part of red teaming and penetration testing methodologies.

## ⚖️ Pros and Cons

### ✅ Pros:
- High accuracy and detail in information gathering
- Helps in identifying real-time vulnerabilities
- Crucial for crafting effective exploits and payloads

### ❌ Cons:
- Not stealthy — may trigger IDS/IPS or alert the target
- May be considered intrusive if done without authorization
- Can be legally risky without proper scope and permission

## 🛠 Tools We Used

This repository explores and documents the usage of the following tools for active reconnaissance:

- **Nmap** – Network mapper for scanning ports and services
- **Hping3** – TCP/IP packet crafter for advanced scanning and probing
- **WhatWeb** – Website technology identifier
- **BuiltWith** – Online tool to discover web technologies in use
