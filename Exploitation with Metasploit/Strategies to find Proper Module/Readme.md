# 🔍 Strategy for Finding the Proper Module in Metasploit

As Metasploit continues to grow with **over 3000 modules**, navigating its vast functionality can be overwhelming — especially for newcomers. One of the most essential tools in your Metasploit toolkit is the `search` command.

This README will walk you through how to **efficiently search for the right module** using Metasploit's built-in filters.

---

## ⚙️ Basic Search Syntax

The `search` command can be customized using the format:

```
search keyword:value
```

You can combine multiple filters to narrow down your results.

## 🔑 Common Search Filters

| Filter     | Description                                              | Example                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `type`     | Type of module (e.g., `exploit`, `auxiliary`, `payload`) | `type:exploit`             |
| `platform` | Target OS or environment (e.g., `windows`, `linux`)      | `platform:windows`         |
| Keyword    | Module name or keyword in its description                | `smb`, `ftp`, `flash`      |

---

## 🧪 Examples

### 1. Search All Exploits
```bash
msf5 > search type:exploit
```

### 2. Exploits for Windows SMB
```bash
msf5 > search type:exploit platform:windows smb
```

### 3. Adobe Flash Exploits on Windows
```bash
msf5 > search type:exploit platform:windows flash
```

## 📖 Viewing Module Details

Once you find a module, use the `info` command to learn more:

```bash
msf5 > info exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

This gives you full details like:
- Module description
- Author
- Platform
- Payload compatibility
- Required options

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Avoid generic searches like `search smb` – they return too many results.
- Combine filters for efficient results.
- Use `info` before `use` to fully understand the module.

## 📚 Conclusion

By mastering the `search` function, you'll drastically reduce your time and effort navigating Metasploit. It's a vital skill for anyone serious about **penetration testing**, **red teaming**, or **ethical hacking**.
