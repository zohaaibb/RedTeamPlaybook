## Keywords

From the `msfconsole`, you can enter system commands (e.g., `ifconfig`, `ping`, etc.) as well as Metasploit’s built-in **keywords**. To view all available commands, use:

```bash
help
```

Although Metasploit is a powerful exploitation framework, just a handful of commands are enough to get you started. Below are some of the most commonly used keywords in Metasploit.

---

### `use`

Loads a specific module. For example, to load an Adobe Flash browser exploit:

```bash
use exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flash_avm2
```

Once loaded, you'll see the module path and type displayed, and the prompt changes accordingly.

---

### `show`

Used to gather more information about a module. Most commonly used subcommands:

- `show options` – Displays required and optional settings for the module.
- `show payloads` – Lists payloads compatible with the selected exploit.
- `show targets` – Lists specific platforms or versions the exploit works against.

Example:

```bash
show payloads
```

If no exploit is loaded, this will list **all payloads** (over 500). If an exploit is selected, it will only list compatible ones.

```bash
show options
```

Displays configurable variables such as:

- `RHOSTS` – Remote host IP
- `LHOST` – Local (attacker) IP
- `RPORT` – Remote port
- `LPORT` – Local port

---

### `set`

Used to define values for module variables.

```bash
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.101
set LHOST 192.168.1.5
set SRVPORT 80
```

---

### `unset`

Used to clear a previously set variable and revert to the default.

```bash
unset SRVPORT
```

---

### `info`

Displays detailed information about the currently loaded module, including:

- Description
- Required options
- Payload compatibility
- Vulnerability references
- Platform and architecture

Example:

```bash
info
```

---

### `exploit`

Runs the loaded exploit with the configured settings.

```bash
exploit
```

Once executed, the exploit may:

- Open a reverse shell or Meterpreter session.
- Start a listener.
- Launch a web server (for browser exploits).
- Use a randomized or user-defined URI path.

---

### `back`

Unloads the current module and returns to the previous `msfconsole` prompt.

```bash
back
```

---

### `exit`

Exits the `msfconsole` and returns to the system shell (e.g., Bash).

```bash
exit
```

If a web server or listener was started, it will be terminated automatically.

---

These keyword commands form the core of using Metasploit effectively. Mastery of them will allow you to navigate the framework with confidence and perform successful exploitation workflows.
